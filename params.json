Here is where I will post some of my Beta and finished custom Bukkit plugins! You can also find some of my stuff on [Bukkit Dev](http://dev.bukkit.org)!\r\n\r\n### About Jedeyeboba\r\nJedeyeboba is an amateur Plugin developer, but is an experienced [Minecraft](http://www.minecraft.net) player. He has his eyes set on creating custom Bukkit plugins that have never been thought of before! Currently, he is creating plugins for his private server. Unfortunately, he is not currently accepting commissions, although that may be an option in the future!\r\n\r\n### Plugins In Progress\r\n\r\nJedeyeboba is currently working on a new plugin: SherlockIsBored. This plugin, based off of BBC's television show [Sherlock](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b018ttws), adds the simple ability to be... bored.\r\n\r\n### Thank you for visiting my GitHub page!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
